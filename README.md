# __Portfolio Project 1 - HTML and CSS__
## __Cake and Bake__

Meena Rhodes is a part time baker working out of her own home in South Croydon, London, UK. She has been creating delicious delights for over a decade and built an impressive home business. She is active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cakeandbakeldn/?hl=en) and has built a following of just over 700 people. 

Meena is often asked by her clients if she has a website that can be shared with potential clients. As a result she is seeking the design and development of a functioning website that will showcase her work and allow potential clients to get in touch.

The first stage of this website will be to develop a HTML/CSS based website that meets user experience objectives set out in this document.
